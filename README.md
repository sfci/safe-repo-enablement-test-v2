# safe-repo-enablement-test-v2

This is a smoketest to test the `enable-safe-repo-pilot` flag. If this flag is added to `.strata.yml` file, the pipeline will use the Nexus Safe Repo URL instead of the existing Nexus URL.
More details about the Safe Repo program can be found [here](https://salesforce.quip.com/9JFGAybHgyTx?thread_open_referrer=slack_chat&app=slack_app).
